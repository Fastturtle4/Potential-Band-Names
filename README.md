Potential band names for whenever I develop musical talent (and the circumstances that led me to think of them):

Distant Bark - I heard a dog bark... from a distance

Resounding Thud - I heard a door close with a resounding thud (lots of ideas based on sound??)

Fleet of Cats - I really don't even know

MouseRat - Actually this one is already taken by Andy from Parks and Recreation...

Pocket of Ostriches - inspired by my Machine Learning teacher lecturing about adversarial images to fool convolutional neural networks. How a bus can be classified as an ostrich: there's a pocket of ostriches on the decision boundary of the bus class.

More to come, stay tuned
